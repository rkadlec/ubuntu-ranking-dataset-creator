Scripts for generating the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, and information about corpus contents.

## UPDATES FROM UBUNTU CORPUS v1.0:

Version 2.0 of the corpus is not compatible with Version 1.0, and performance results should not be compared between the two. However, models that do well on the first dataset should also do well on the second dataset but may require a new hyperparameter search.

- Train/validation/test sets separated by date to more closely mimics real life implementation, where you are training a model on past data to predict future data.
  - *Training set* -- Jan 2004 to April 27, 2012
  - *Validation set* -- April 27 to August 7, 2012
  - *Test set* -- August 7 to December 1, 2012
- Changed the sampling procedure for the context length in the validation and test sets, from an inverse distribution to a uniform distribution (between 2 and the max context size). This increases the average context length, which we consider desirable since we would like to model long-term dependencies.
- Changed the tokenization and entity replacement procedure. After complaints stating v1 was too aggressive, we've decided to remove these. It is up to each person using the dataset to come up with their own tokenization/ entity replacement scheme. We plan to use the tokenization internally.
- Added differentiation between the end of an utterance (`__eou__`) and end of turn (`__eot__`). In the original dataset, we concatenated all consecutive utterances by the same user in to one utterance, and put `__EOS__` at the end. Here, we also denote where the original utterances were (with `__eou__`). Also, the terminology should now be consistent between the training and test set (instead of both `__EOS__` and `</s>`).
- Fixed a bug that caused the distribution of false responses in the test and validation sets to be different from the true responses. In particular, the number of words in the false responses was shorter on average than for the true responses, which could have been exploited by some models.

## UBUNTU CORPUS GENERATION FILES:
<<<<<<< HEAD

### `generate.sh`

Script that calls `create_ubuntu_dataset.py`. This is the script you should run in order to download the dataset. The parameters passed to this script will be passed to `create_ubuntu_dataset.py`. Example usage: `./generate.sh -t -s -l`.

### `create_ubuntu_dataset.py`

### create_ubuntu_dataset.py:
#### DESCRIPTION:
>>>>>>> 481182591b91173713f23812ce726fe64ad91209
Script for generation of train, test and valid datasets from Ubuntu Corpus 1 on 1 dialogs.
The script downloads 1on1 dialogs from internet and then it randomly samples all the datasets with positive and negative examples.

#### ARGUMENTS:

=======
#### ARGUMENTS:
>>>>>>> 481182591b91173713f23812ce726fe64ad91209
- `--data_root`: directory where 1on1 dialogs will downloaded and extracted, the data will be downloaded from [cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/datasets/ubuntu-corpus-1.0/ubuntu_dialogs.tgz](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/datasets/ubuntu-corpus-1.0/ubuntu_dialogs.tgz) (default = '.')
- `--seed`: seed for random number generator (default = 1234)
- `-o`, `--output`: output file for writing to csv (default = None)
- `-t`, `--tokenize`: tokenize the output (`nltk.word_tokenize`)
- `-s`, `--stem`: stem the output (`nltk.stem.SnowballStemmer`) - applied only when `-t` flag is present
- `-l`, `--lemmatize`: lemmatize the output (`nltk.stem.WorldNetLemmatizer`) - applied only when `-t` flag is present

*Note:* if both `-s` and `-l` are present, the stemmer is applied before the lemmatizer.

#### Subparsers:
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> 481182591b91173713f23812ce726fe64ad91209
`train`: train set generator
- `-p`: positive example probability, ie. the ratio of positive examples to total examples in the training set (default = 0.5)
- `-e`, `--examples`: number of training examples to generate. Note that this will generate slightly fewer examples than desired, as there is a 'post-processing' step that filters  (default = 1000000)

`valid`: validation set generator
- `-n`: number of distractor examples for each context (default = 9)

`test`: test set generator
- `-n`: number of distractor examples for each context (default = 9)

### meta folder

testfiles.csv

#### DESCRIPTION:

Maps the original dialogue files to the training, validation, and test sets.


## UBUNTU CORPUS FILES (after generating)

### train.csv

Contains the training set. It is separated into 3 columns: the context of the conversation, the candidate response or 'utterance', and a flag or 'label' (= 0 or 1) denoting whether the response is a 'true response' to the context (flag = 1), or a randomly drawn response from elsewhere in the dataset (flag = 0). This triples format is described in the paper. When generated with the default settings, train.csv is 463Mb, with 1,000,000 lines (ie. examples, which corresponds to 449,071 dialogues) and with a vocabulary size of ~~1,344,621~~. Note that, to generate the full dataset, you should use the `--examples` argument for the `create_ubuntu_dataset.py` file.

### valid.csv

Contains the validation set. Each row represents a question. Separated into 11 columns: the context, the true response or 'ground truth utterance', and 9 false responses or 'distractors' that were randomly sampled from elsewhere in the dataset. Your model gets a question correct if it selects the ground truth utterance from amongst the 10 possible responses. When generated with the default settings, `valid.csv` is 27Mb, with 19,561 lines and a vocabulary size of 115,688.

### test.csv

Contains the test set. Formatted in the same way as the validation set. When generated with the default settings, test.csv is 27Mb, with 18,921 lines and a vocabulary size of 115,623.
